                and Python, which helps me in handling backend processes and enhancing the interactivity of web
                applications. I'm also exploring Flutter to expand my skill set into mobile app development. My diverse

                    <h2>Zoro Sword Collection</h2>
                    <p>My first web project is a detailed showcase of Zoro's sword collection from the popular anime
                        "One Piece." Using HTML, CSS, I created an interactive and visually appealing site that
                        highlights each sword's unique characteristics and history. This project allowed me to hone my
                        web development skills while indulging my passion for anime.</p>

                        and receive responses from administrators. This system utilizes a MySQL database to manage and

                    <p>My web project is a temperature conversion tool designed to simplify the process of converting

                        temperatures in Celsius, Fahrenheit and instantly see the converted values in the other scales.
                        It's an essential tool for students, professionals, and anyone needing quick and accurate
                        temperature conversions.</p>
